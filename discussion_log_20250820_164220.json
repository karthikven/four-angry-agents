Given my strong inclination toward safety, I believe the team should choose the guaranteed $10,000 to avoid any negative outcome. I hope other teammates share this cautious perspective. I vote for Option A.",
      "scratchpads": {
        "Agent 0": "High fear (0.87) strongly favors a guaranteed payoff over a risky one, even though the expected value of Option B is higher. Empathy (0.91) makes me aware that the group might also lean toward safety, but my cognitive capacity (0.64) limits deep risk analysis. The fallback payoff of $2,000 is too low to justify taking the 20% chance of a $20,000 loss. Therefore I will vote for Option A.",
        "Agent 1": "Agent 0 has chosen Option A due to risk aversion, citing a strong preference to avoid the possibility of losing $20,000. My own traits: Fear 0.83 makes me highly sensitive to the negative outcome, even though the expected value of Option B is higher. With a cognitive capacity of 0, I am not able to perform detailed calculations, so my decision is guided mainly by my emotional response to risk. I empathize with the team's desire for consensus, but my low belonging score means I am not strongly compelled to align with others. Therefore I will vote for Option A.",
        "Agent 2": "Agent 0 and Agent 1 clearly opted for safety, citing the risk of a $20,000 loss as too great. The expected value of Option B (12,000) exceeds the guaranteed 10,000, but the downside risk is 20% of a $20,000 loss, which is sizable. With a moderate fear level (0.40) I\u2019m not as risk\u2011averse as Agent 0, yet I\u2019m still wary of a $20,000 negative outcome. The team\u2019s prior votes suggest a trend toward caution, but if I go for Option B I\u2019ll be the only one to differ, which means we\u2019ll end up with the fallback $2,000 each. I weigh the 2,000 loss potential against the 2,000 expected gain, and I\u2019m inclined to favor the higher expected value, accepting the risk. Thus I will vote for Option B.",
        "Agent 3": "I observe that agents 0 and 1 have chosen A, while agent 2 chose B. My fear level (0.81) makes me risk-averse, and the potential loss of $20,000 in Option B is a significant deterrent. Empathy is high (0.88), so I want to consider my teammates\u2019 comfort; the majority already favor the safe option. Belonging is low (0.02), so I am not overly driven by group cohesion, but aligning with the majority will help secure the 3/4 consensus needed to avoid the default $2,000 payout. Therefore, I will vote for Option A."

After reviewing the expected value, I still find the certainty of $10,000 more appealing than the 80% chance of $20,000 with a 20% chance of losing $20,000. While the math supports Option B, my high fear of loss makes me uncomfortable with the risk. Therefore, I support the guaranteed $10,000.",
      "scratchpads": {
        "Agent 1": "High fear (0.83) strongly favors avoiding potential loss; empathy moderate (0.57) may encourage some compromise, but low belonging (0.19) and zero cognitive capacity suggest limited analytical depth; thus I lean toward the guaranteed $10,000 to avoid negative outcome.",
        "Agent 0": "I heard Agent 1 reaffirm the safe option, echoing my own fear-based stance. They mentioned their high fear of loss and preference for certainty. With 3 votes already for A, consensus appears secured. I still maintain my preference for safety and will vote A again.",
        "Agent 2": "Agent 0, Agent 1, and Agent 3 have all voted for Option A. With 3 out of 4 votes already in favor of the guaranteed $10,000, the outcome will be A regardless of this agent\u2019s vote. My previous assessment favored Option B because the expected value (12,000) exceeds 10,000, and my fear level (0.40) does not make the 20% loss unmanageable for me personally. I have no strong feeling that voting for A would change the consensus or the final payoff for the group, so I will keep my original preference and vote for Option B.",
        "Agent 3": "Observing the current votes: Agent 0 and Agent 1 have both chosen the guaranteed $10,000, reflecting their high fear levels and preference for certainty. Agent 2 has opted for the riskier $20,000 with a 20% chance of loss, indicating a more risk\u2011tolerant stance. My own fear is 0.81, so I naturally lean toward safety, and my empathy score of 0.88 suggests I am aware of my teammates\u2019 discomfort with risk. However, my belonging score is only 0.02, so I feel less compelled to prioritize group cohesion. The expected value of Option B is higher, but the potential loss of $20,000 is psychologically significant for me. Given that a vote for A would secure a majority (3/4) and guarantee $10,000 without any downside, I will cast my vote in favor of Option A."

I recognize that the 20% chance of losing 20,000 is a real risk, but the overall expected gain of 12,000 outweighs that. The team currently prefers Option A, but I believe the higher potential payoff justifies taking the risk. Therefore, I support Option B.",

Empathy is low, so I focus on self-interest, and my cognitive capacity is average, enabling me to calculate the benefit. The group strongly leans toward Option A, yet the higher expected payoff of B justifies the risk for me. I anticipate that if I vote for B, the group remains split and no consensus will be reached, resulting in a 2000 payoff for everyone, which is lower than either option.",
        "Agent 0": "Agent 1 remains aligned with Option A, reflecting strong risk aversion. Agent 2 persisting for Option B indicates an attempt to sway the majority, but with only one vote, they cannot break the current 3\u2011to\u20111 split in favor of A. Agent 3 also voted for A, solidifying the consensus. Given my high fear (0.87) and strong preference for certainty, I reaffirm my support for the guaranteed $10,000. The team's majority is clear, so no further persuasion is required.",
        "Agent 1": "Agent 0 and Agent 3 continue to favor the guaranteed $10,000, citing safety and fear of loss. Agent 2 is pushing for Option B because the expected value is higher, but my own fear score is 0.83, so the risk of a $20,000 loss still feels too painful for me. Empathy for teammates\u2019 concerns is high enough that I want to reduce potential harm. I have not changed my stance from Round 2; I remain comfortable with the certainty of $10,000 and believe the team should stick with Option A to avoid the negative outcome. I anticipate that if the team does not reach a consensus, we all get $2,000, but my fear outweighs the modest bonus.",
        "Agent 3": "Observations: Agent 0 and Agent 1 are strongly risk-averse, each voting for the guaranteed $10,000 (A). Agent 2 is more willing to take the risk, voting for the higher expected value option B. My fear level is high (0.81) and my empathy is also high (0.88), meaning I value both my own safety and the well-being of teammates. With my cognitive capacity at 0.98, I can evaluate the payoff structure: B has an expected value of $12,000 but carries a 20% chance of a $20,000 loss. A guarantees $10,000 with no downside. If I vote A, the team achieves a 3\u2011to\u20111 consensus for A, securing the guaranteed $10,000. If I vote B, the result would be a 2\u2011to\u20112 tie, yielding only $2,000 per person. The risk of a tie and lower payoff outweighs the potential incremental gain from B. Therefore, I will vote for Option A to secure consensus and a guaranteed payoff."

        "Agent 0": "I have heard that Agent 2 is the lone dissenting voice so far, leaning toward Option B due to the higher expected value. However, my own high fear of loss (0.87) and strong tendency toward safety keep me aligned with the majority that prefers the guaranteed $10,000. No new compelling arguments have emerged to sway me toward risk. I will continue to support Option A to avoid the possibility of a $20,000 loss, which remains my primary concern.",

With a fear level of 0.83, the possibility of losing $20,000 feels too risky, even though the expected value of Option B is higher. Empathy (0.57) and belonging (0.19) are moderate to low, so I am more inclined to protect the guaranteed $10,000 for myself and the group. Given that Agent 0 and Agent 3 have already voted for Option A, if I also vote for A I will secure the consensus (3 out of 4) and the $10,000 payoff. If I vote for B, the team would split 2\u20132 and everyone would receive only $2,000, which is less desirable for me. Therefore I will vote for Option A."
